# ROBOTICS HACKATHON (20.01.2024) - Line Follower
A twelve-hour line follower hackathon serves as the concluding project for the third-year Introduction to Robotics course

### Task:
#### The objective is for the robot to precisely track the line, aiming for the most accurate performance to complete the course. The robot is allowed three attempts to achieve the fastest time.

  Components:
- Arduino Uno
- Power source: LiPo battery
- Two wheels
- QTR-8A reflectance sensor
- Ball caster
- L293D motor driver
- Two DC motors
- Medium breadboard
- Wires (M - F, M - M), zip-ties, screws as needed

  For the chassis we cut into a foam board after measuring an apropriate distance between the wheels and for the sensor. We improvised "pockets" for the breadboard and battery and we secured the Arduino board and the motors using zip-ties.
